# vbAccelerator.com Archive
This repo is a last-ditch attempt to archive the venerable vbAccelerator website (and code samples), which disappeared from the web in November 2015.  Thank you to [vbForums user fafalone](http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?812569-vbAccelerator-site-gone) for having the foresight to archive everything in advance.  This archive is based off his work.

The original vbAccelerator website and code samples were provided under a [Generic CC 1.0 Attribution license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/), so barring additional information on a particular page or .zip file, that license should cover the entirety of the repository.

All text, code, and images are assumed Copyright Â© 2004 Steve McMahon, vbAccelerator Ltd, per the original site footer.  Many thanks to to Steve for his valuable work, and for keeping his site online as long as he did.

**Update July 2018:** at some point in the past few years, the [vbaccelerator website](http://www.vbaccelerator.com/) returned from the dead.  Unfortunately, its formatting is broken, many of its internal links go nowhere, and various downloads no longer work.  Unfortunately, that means this barebones repository is still easier to navigate than the site itself (sigh).
